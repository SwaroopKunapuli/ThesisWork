  abstract = {The Microcanonical Metropolis Monte Carlo method, based on a random sampling of the density of states, is revisited for the study of molecular fragmentation in the gas phase (isolated molecules, atomic and molecular clusters, complex biomolecules, etc.). A random walk or uniform random sampling in the configurational space (atomic positions) and a uniform random sampling of the relative orientation, vibrational energy, and chemical composition of the fragments is used to estimate the density of states of the system, which is continuously updated as the random sampling populates individual states. The validity and usefulness of the method is demonstrated by applying it to evaluate the caloric curve of a weakly bound rare gas cluster (Ar13), to interpret the fragmentation of highly excited small neutral and singly positively charged carbon clusters (Cn, n = 5,7,9 and Cn+, n = 4,5) and to simulate the mass spectrum of the acetylene molecule (C2H2).},

  abstract = {The development of post-Hartree-Fock (postHF) energy decomposition schemes that are able to decompose the HF and correlation components of the interaction energy into chemically meaningful contributions is a very active field of research. One of the challenges is to provide a clear-cut quantification to the elusive London dispersion component of the intermolecular interaction. London dispersion is well-known to be a pure correlation effect, and as such it is not properly described by mean field theories. In this context, we have recently developed the local energy decomposition (LED) analysis, which provides a chemically meaningful decomposition of the interaction energy between two or more fragments computed at the domain-based local pair natural orbitals coupled cluster (DLPNO-CCSD(T)) level of theory. In this work, this scheme is used in conjunction with other interpretation tools to study a series of molecular adducts held together by intermolecular interactions of different natures. The HF and correlation components of the interaction energy are thus decomposed into a series of chemically meaningful contributions. Emphasis is placed on discussing the physical effects associated with the inclusion of electron correlation. It is found that four distinct physical effects can contribute to the magnitude of the correlation part of intermolecular binding energies ({$\Delta$}EiCnt): (i) London dispersion, (ii) the correlation correction to the reference induction energy, (iii) the correlation correction to the electron sharing process, and (iv) the correlation correction to the permanent electrostatics. As expected, the largest contribution to the correlation binding energy of neutral, apolar molecules is London dispersion, as in the argon dimer case. In contrast, the correction for the HF induction energy dominates {$\Delta$}EiCnt in systems in which an apolar molecule interacts with charged or strongly polar species, as in Ar-Li+. This effect has its origin in the systematic underestimation of polarizabilities at the HF level of theory. For similar reasons, electron sharing largely contributes to the correlation binding energy of covalently bound molecules, as in the beryllium dimer case. Finally, the correction for HF permanent electrostatics significantly contributes to {$\Delta$}EiCnt in molecules with strong dipoles, such as water and hydrogen fluoride dimers. This effect originates from the characteristic overestimation of dipole moments at the HF level of theory, leading in some cases to positive {$\Delta$}EiCnt values. Our results are apparently in contrast to the widely accepted view that {$\Delta$}EiCnt is typically dominated by London dispersion, at least, in the strongly interacting region. Clearly, postHF energy decomposition schemes are very powerful tools to analyze, categorize, and understand the various contributions to the intermolecular interaction energy. Hopefully, this will eventually lead to insights that are helpful in designing systems with tailored properties. All analysis tools presented in this work will be available free of charge in the next release of the ORCA program package.},

A combination of computational and vibrational spectroscopy tools, including inelastic neutron scattering (INS), have been used to probe intermolecular interactions in the eutectic mixture. Reline's experimental spectra were estimated using discrete and periodic               ab initio               calculations of a molecular aggregate with two choline chloride and four urea units. This is the minimum size required to achieve satisfactory agreement with experiment, as smaller clusters cannot represent all of reline's significant intermolecular interactions. The INS spectrum of reline, compared with that of pure choline chloride, reveals a displacement of chloride anions away from their preferred positions on top of choline's methyl groups, whose torsional movement becomes less hindered in the mixture. Urea, which adopts a planar (sp               2               ) shape in the crystal, becomes non-planar (sp               3               ) in reline, a feature herein discussed for the first time. In reline, urea molecules form a wide range of hydrogen bonds, from soft contacts to stronger associations, the latter being responsible for the deviation from ideality. The chloride's interactions with choline are largely conserved at the hydroxyl end while becoming weaker at the cationic headgroup. The interplay of soft and strong interactions confers flexibility to the newly formed hydrogen-bond network and allows the ensemble to remain liquid at room temperature.},

  abstract = {Computational analysis indicates flexibility and diversity in the hydrogen bonding, but limited charge delocalisation, within the choline chloride--urea eutectic.           ,                             Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are exemplars of systems with the ability to form neutral, ionic and doubly ionic H-bonds. Herein, the pairwise interactions of the constituent components of the choline chloride--urea DES are examined. Evidence is found for a tripodal CH{$\cdots$}Cl doubly ionic H-bond motif. Moreover it is found that the covalency of doubly ionic H-bonds can be greater than, or comparable with, neutral and ionic examples. In contrast to many traditional solvents, an ``alphabet soup'' of many different types of H-bond (OH{$\cdots$}OC, NH{$\cdots$}OC, OH{$\cdots$}Cl, NH{$\cdots$}Cl, OH{$\cdots$}NH, CH{$\cdots$}Cl, CH{$\cdots$}OC, NH{$\cdots$}OH and NH{$\cdots$}NH) can form. These H-bonds exhibit substantial flexibility in terms of number and strength. It is anticipated that H-bonding will have a significant impact on the entropy of the system and thus could play an important role in the formation of the eutectic. The 2\,:\,1 urea\,:\,choline--chloride eutectic point of this DES is often associated with the formation of a [Cl(urea)               2               ]               -               complexed anion. However, urea is found to form a H-bonded urea[choline]               +               complexed cation that is energetically competitive with [Cl(urea)               2               ]               -               .

This is the first reported liquid-phase neutron diffraction experiment on a cholinium DES. H/D isotopic substitution is used to obtain differential neutron scattering cross sections, and an Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) model is fitted to the experimental data. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) derived from EPSR reveal the presence of the anticipated hydrogen bonding network within the liquid, with significant ordering interactions not only between urea and chloride, but between all DES components. Spatial density functions (SDFs) are used to map the 3D structure of the solvent. Interestingly, choline is found to contribute strongly to this bonding network               via               the hydroxyl group, giving rise to a radially layered structure with ordering between all species. The void size distribution function calculated for reline suggests that the holes present within DESs are far smaller than previously suggested by hole theory.

The objective of this article is to develop an atomic population analysis method that is suitable to be used as a default method in quantum chemistry programs irrespective of the kind of basis sets employed. To address this challenge, we introduce a new atoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties: (1) exactly one electron distribution is assigned to each atom, (2) core electrons are assigned to the correct host atom, (3) NACs are formally independent of the basis set type because they are functionals of the total electron distribution, (4) the assigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging polyatomic multipole expansion, (5) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling scale electronegativity trends, (6) NACs for a particular element have good transferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded, (7) the assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin moments, (8) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a unique solution, and (9) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales linearly with increasing system size. We study numerous materials as examples: (a) a series of endohedral C               60               complexes, (b) high-pressure compressed sodium chloride crystals with unusual stoichiometries, (c) metal--organic frameworks, (d) large and small molecules, (e) organometallic complexes, (f) various solids, and (g) solid surfaces. Due to non-nuclear attractors, Bader's quantum chemical topology could not assign NACs for some of these materials. We show for the first time that the Iterative Hirshfeld and DDEC3 methods do not always converge to a unique solution independent of the initial guess, and this sometimes causes those methods to assign dramatically different NACs on symmetry-equivalent atoms. By using a fixed number of charge partitioning steps with well-defined reference ion charges, the DDEC6 method avoids this problem by always converging to a unique solution. These characteristics make the DDEC6 method ideally suited for use as a default charge assignment method in quantum chemistry programs.},

  abstract = {We propose and discuss an efficient scheme for the in silico sampling for parts of the molecular chemical space by semiempirical tight-binding methods combined with a meta-dynamics driven search algorithm. The focus of this work is set on the generation of proper thermodynamic ensembles at a quantum chemical level for conformers, but similar procedures for protonation states, tautomerism and non-covalent complex geometries are also discussed. The conformational ensembles consisting of all significantly populated minimum energy structures normally form the basis of further, mostly DFT computational work, such as the calculation of spectra or macroscopic properties. By using basic quantum chemical methods, electronic effects or possible bond breaking/formation are accounted for and a very reasonable initial energetic ranking of the candidate structures is obtained. Due to the huge computational speedup gained by the fast low-cost quantum chemical methods, overall short computation times even for systems with hundreds of atoms (typically drug-sized molecules) are achieved. Furthermore, specialized applications, such as sampling with implicit solvation models or constrained conformational sampling for transition-states, metal-, surface-, or noncovalently bound complexes are discussed, opening many possible applications in modern computational chemistry and drug discovery. The procedures have been implemented in a freely available computer code called CREST, that makes use of the fast and reliable GFNn-xTB methods.},

Benchmark experimental data for this biologically important system are complemented with theory to elucidate the details of the collision-induced activation process. Experimental energy thresholds for successive release of water are compared to water dissociation energies from DFT calculations showing that clusters do not only fragment exclusively by sequential emission of single water molecules but also by the release of small water clusters. Release of clustered water is observed also in the ADMP (atom centered density matrix propagation) molecular dynamics model of small Cys(H               2               O)               3               +               and Cys(H               2               O)               3               H               +               clusters. For large clusters Cys(H               2               O)               6               +               and Cys(H               2               O)               6               H               +               the less computationally demanding statistical Microcanonical Metropolis Monte--Carlo method (M               3               C) is used to model the experimental fragmentation patterns. We are able to detail the energy redistribution in clusters upon collision activation. In the present case, about two thirds of the collision energy redistribute               via               an ergodic process, while the remaining one third is transferred into a non-ergodic channel leading to ejection of a single water molecule from the cluster. In contrast to molecular fragmentation, which can be well described by statistical models, modelling of collision-induced activation of weakly bound clusters requires inclusion of non-ergodic processes.},
