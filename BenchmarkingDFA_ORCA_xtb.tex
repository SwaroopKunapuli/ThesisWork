\section{Benchmarking density functional approximations}
List of available methods and codes for speeding up the optimization calculations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ORCA (DFA and composite methods)
    \item CENSO (with ORCA as the QM calculation driver and xTB as the semi-empirical method; parameters already benchmarked by Grimme's lab)
    \item ML-based methods (AIQM1 method in MLatom 3)
\end{enumerate}
