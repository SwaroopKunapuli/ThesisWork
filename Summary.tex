\section{Summary of third year work}
Since the last CSI, the following projects were undertaken and certain protocols and work flows were developed based on the benchmarking of certain semi-empirical and density functional approximation methods. 
The following projects were undertaken:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Developing the algorithm for fragmentation simulations of non-covalent clusters}
    \item Studying the stability and water retention properties of the proposed NADES systems in lichen EverniaPrunastri.
\end{enumerate}
