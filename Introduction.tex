\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
For the last few decades, a new class of solvents callled Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) have garnered much attention from researchers interested in finding solvents tailor-made for specific applications. DES are a mixture of two or more components that form a eutectic mixture with a melting point lower than that of the individual components.
The invention of DES lead to the studies of wide-range of applications as their nature and tailoring help in significant processes. The modeling of DES as helps as they explain the experimental observations and help in the design of DES. In this thesis, the DES systems considered are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Urea - Choline Chloride (1:2 molar ratio) colloquially called Reline.
\item Evernic Acid - Usinic Acid NADES found in the lichen \textit{EverniaPrunastri}
\end{enumerate}
And the following modeling strategies/tools were utilised for this purpose:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Molecular Dynamics
\item Fragmentation Simulations

\end{enumerate}
